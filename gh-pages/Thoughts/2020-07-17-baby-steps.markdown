First Blog Post: A Programmer's Baby Steps

A year ago, I quit my job at a factory in 	Dongguan, China and went home. Due to geographical restrictions, long working hour (often from 8a.m. to 8p.m.), and six-day workweek, I had minimal time spared to do any non-work activities, not to mention meeting anyone out of work. What I want the ost is to meet new people and make connections, but the job simply did not provide enough opportunities. So, I handed in that letter and waved goodbye to the company.

My plan was to take a short break and start a new career. However, things went wrong as the pandemic began breaking out of control.  I almost got a job at a bank in January  2020. Unfortunately, the bank froze all headcount as the news of the coronavirus spreads.  Imagine you are in a football match, you dribbled pass the last player of the opponent team. All of a sudden, a racoon came out of nowhere and stole the ball away before you claim your goal. (What's worse, the racoon is still here pestering all of us!) Since then, the job market became quiet. And I started looking around for other options.

Programming was one of the things that I looked into. To be honest, I did not expect to enjoy it at all. I learned a little bit of coding with VBA at school. I only used it once to build a small petty cash bookkeeping application. Coding with VBA did not add too much value to my previous jobs, and I definitely won't re-learn it unless somebody pays me enough money. But Python took me to a whole new world. I started learning it by taking an introductory course taught by Dr Charles Severance: [Python for Everybody][jekyll docs]. The course was really eye-opening. I did not know that I could parse a website or generate graphs for data representation with just a few lines of codes!



Now I am taking more programming courses on different platforms with various instructors, soaking my brain in codes everyday. I hope I can learn more and utilize what I learned to eventually build something awe-inspiring. This little blog post is a small step, I will follow up with more and more.

p.s. This website is under construction. I will make it look prettier, but the posts can go first.
